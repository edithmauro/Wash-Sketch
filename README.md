# Wash-Sketch
This project includes creating a sketch of a png image, and then filling in color into the sketch to be a close match to the original image.  Included in this file is the image that the project was based off of, the sketch, and the final image with color.  Both the sketch and the colored work was created using a combination of Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.
